Start Game.java first. The program will wait until
Client.java is opened.

Run Client.java and It will ask for ip adress. If you are
opening both client and game in just one computer, 
you can write localhost or just leave the space empty.
Otherwise you should write the ip adress of the computer
which has GAME.java running on.
